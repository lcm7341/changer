# changer

This is a little website that finds the optimal change to give someone.

It was truly just a simple little project to learn a bit about Rust's Actix Web, and I felt like I learned a good amount.

The CSS is admittedly vibecoded, because I don't have time for that. Nothing else is, however.

Of course, I understand this is not a project that necessarily requires Actix, or Rust for that matter, but it was just a learning experience.
